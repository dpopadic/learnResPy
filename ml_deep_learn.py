# Deep Learning in Python
# -----------------------
# deep learning libraries: 1) keras & tensorflow
# foundations for advanced applications to image, text, audio, video & more
# - neural networks account for interactions really well
# - deep learning uses especially powerful for neural networks

# 1. Basics of deep learning and neural networks
