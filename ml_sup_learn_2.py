# 1 Classification and Regression Trees
# -------------------------------------
# classification-tree: sequence of if-else questions about individual features to infer labels
# - captures non-linear relationships between features & labels
# - don't require feature scaling (eg. standardization)

# decision region: region in the feature space where all instances are assigned to one class label
# decision boundary: surface separating different decision regions
