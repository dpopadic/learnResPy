# conditional probabilities

# Base case: You're testing for a disease and advertising that the test is 99% accurate; that is
# if you have the disease, you will test positive 99% of the time, and if you don't have the
# disease, you will test negative 99% of the time. Let's say that 1% of all people have the disease
# and someone tests positive. What's the probability that the person has the disease?
# .. prob = (0.99 * 0.01) / (0.99 * 0.01 + 0.01 * 0.99)


# Baye's theorem: p(a | b) = p(a & b) / p(b) = p(b | a) * p(a) / p(b)

# Baye's theorem applied: Out of the two coins, one is a real coin and the other one is a faulty coin
# with tails on both sides. You are blindfolded and forced to choose a random coin and then toss it in
# the air. The coin lands with tails facing upwards. Find the probability that this is the faulty coin.

# probabilities:
# prob(tails): 0.25
# prob(faulty): 0.75
# prob(tails & faulty): 0.5 * 1
# prob(faulty | tails):  0.5 / 0.75


# central limit theorem
