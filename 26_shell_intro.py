# Intro to Shell for Data Science
# -------------------------------

# The Unix command line has survived and thrived for almost fifty years because it lets people do complex things
# with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes called "the universal glue of programming", it helps users combine existing
# programs in new ways, automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and clouds that may be halfway around
# the world. This course will introduce its key elements and show you how to use them efficiently.

# 1. Manipulating files and directories
# -------------------------------------

# How does the shell compare to a desktop interface?
# An operating system like Windows, Linux, or Mac OS is a special kind of program. It controls the computer's
# processor, hard drive, and network connection, but its most important job is to run other programs.

# Since human beings aren't digital, they need an interface to interact with the operating system. The most
# common one these days is a graphical file explorer, which translates clicks and double-clicks into commands to
# open files and run programs. Before computers had graphical displays, though, people typed instructions into a
# program called a command-line shell. Each time a command is entered, the shell runs some other programs, prints
#  their output in human-readable form, and then displays a prompt to signal that it's ready to accept the next
#  command. (Its name comes from the notion that it's the "outer shell" of the computer.)

# Typing commands instead of clicking and dragging may seem clumsy at first, but as you will see, once you start
# spelling out what you want the computer to do, you can combine old commands to create new ones and automate
# repetitive operations with just a few keystrokes.
