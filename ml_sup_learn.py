# Supervised Learning with scikit-Learn
# -------------------------------------
# other popular ML libraries: TensorFlow, keras, scikit-learn integrates well with SciPy stack

# 1. Classification
# -----------------

# ML: the art & science of: giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
# without being explicitly programmed
# examples: learning to predict whether email is spam, clustering wikipedia entries into different categories

# types of ML:
# ---
# supervised: use labeled data
# unsupervised learning: uses unlabeled data
# reinforcement learning: software agents interact with an environment (automatically learn how t
# o optimize their behaviour given a system of rewards & punishments), draws inspiration from behavioural
# psychology (applications in economics, genetics, game playing), reinforcement learning was used in alphaGo

# supervised learning:
# - predictor variables/features and a target variable
# - 2 categories: classification (target variable consists of categories) or regression (target variable is continuous)
