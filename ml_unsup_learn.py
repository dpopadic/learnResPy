# Unsupervised Learning in Python
# -------------------------------


# 1. Clustering for dataset exploration
# -------------------------------------
# Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to
# dimension reduction to matrix factorization
# idea: classify stocks to outperform / underperform and then perform ML techniques instead of traditional ic-analysis

# k-Means..
# ---


# measuring clustering quality..
# ---
# - insertia measures cluster quality: measures how spread out the clusters are (lower is better)
# - distance from each sample to centroid of its cluster
# - choose an "ellbow" in the inertia plot (where inertia begins to decrease more slowly)


# 2. Visualization with hierarchical clustering and t-SNE
# -------------------------------------------------------


# 3. Decorrelating your data and dimension reduction
# --------------------------------------------------


# 4. Discovering interpretable features
