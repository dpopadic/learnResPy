# Python ABC
Python exercises based on various sources

# Summary of Important Commands
- installing packages: python -m pip install pandas (in terminal)
- specific version installation: python -m pip install pandas==0.24.1
- find package version: pip show pandas
- code execution in .py: shift+alt+e
- change code execution command: File -> Settings -> Keymap -> Other -> Execute selection in console
- manage package dependencies:
 1. create a requirements.txt file in root directory of project by: pip freeze > requirements.txt (in terminal)
 2. after pull, create new empty environ incl. global site-packages (delete olt env sub-folders)
 3. run pip install -r requirements.txt
- working directory: import os; os.getcwd(); os.chdir('/Users/dpopadic/PycharmProjects/learnResPy/')
- Math Syntax on Github readme: Download MathJax Plugin for Github for Chrome (to represent $t_{0}$ in maths syntax)
