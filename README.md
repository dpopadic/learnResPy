Key Commands in Python Terminal
-------------------------------

- installing packages: ```python -m pip install pandas```

- specific version installation: ```python -m pip install pandas==0.24.1```

- find package version: ```pip show pandas```

- alter code execution command (default is shift+alt+e): 
```File -> Settings -> Keymap -> Other -> Execute selection in console```

- manage package dependencies:
      1. create a requirements.txt file in root directory of project by: ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
      2. after pull, create new empty environ incl. global site-packages (delete old env sub-folders)
      3. run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- install py-package from github: ```pip install git+https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre.git```


Key Commands in Python Script Editor
------------------------------------

- code completition: Preferences| Editor | General | Code Completition for some settings and ```Ctrl+Space``` 
for code completition after calling a library for example (eg. pd. ```Ctrl+Space``` )
